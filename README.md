## Campaign Template

This layout built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, for integration into Salesforce Account Engagement (AE). Pardot field types implemented to allow in-editor content management and template reuse. When active in AE, integrates with default landing page form. Each application note or optional content starts 'restricted' to push visitors to submit lead generation form (modal). Upon successful completion, links authorize content engagement. While originally built to incorporate javascript via code blocks to allow easy addition of repeatable elements, in reality this was not feasible and those were switched to utilizing HTML editors instead.

## Inventory Manager

This still-in-development web application is intended for personal use, to facilitate home organization. The user is able to create lists and add or remove items. When saved, a QR code is generated to the list. A user could, if desired, print out the list QR codes and attach to storage containers, giving a quick method to recall stored items. The code is available for perusal, and a sample layout is available. Due to reliance of PHP and several libraries for execution, it is nonfunctional in github.
