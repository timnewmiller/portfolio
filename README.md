## Campaign Template

This layout built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, for integration into Salesforce Account Engagement (AE). Pardot field types implemented to allow in-editor content management and template reuse. When active in AE, integrates with default landing page form. Each application note or optional content starts 'restricted' to push visitors to submit lead generation form (modal). Upon successful completion, links authorize content engagement.
